## Learning Objectives

* Basics of network hacking / penetration testing.
* Changing MAC address & bypassing filtering.
* Network mapping.
* ARP Spoofing - redirect the flow of packets in a network.
* DNS Spoofing - Redirect requests from one website to another.
* Spying on any client connected to the network - see usernames, passwords, visited urls ....etc.
* Inject code in pages loaded by any computer connected to the same network.
* Replace files on the fly as they get downloaded by any computer on the same network.
* Detect ARP spoofing attacks.
* Bypass HTTPS.
* Create malware for Windows, OS X and Linux.
* Create trojans for Windows, OS X and Linux.
* Hack Windows, OS X and Linux using custom backdoor.
* Bypass Anti-Virus programs.
* Use fake login prompt to steal credentials.
* Display fake updates.
* Use own keylogger to spy on everything typed on a Windows or OS X computer.
* Learn the basics of website hacking / penetration testing.
* Discover subdomains.
* Discover hidden files and directories in a website.
* Run wordlist attacks to guess login information.
* Discover and exploit XSS vulnerabilities.
* Discover weaknesses in websites using own vulnerability scanner.

## Tasks

| Program         | Description                                                                                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mac_changer     | changes MAC Address to anything we want.                                                                  |
| network_scanner | scans network and discovers the IP and MAC address of all connected clients.                              |
| arp_spoofer     | runs an arp spoofing attack to redirect the flow of packets in the network allowing us to intercept data. |
| packet_sniffer  | filters intercepted data and shows usernames, passwords, visited links ....etc                            |

## Usage

* All files were created and compiled on Mac OS X 10.11 with Python3 (version 3.7)
